# bulb-toggle

This project is my version of W3Schools's bulb on-off code, allowing users to toggle the state of a light bulb image by clicking on it.

## Description

- This project implements a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript solution to toggle the state of a light bulb image between on and off. When the user clicks on the light bulb image, it switches between displaying an illuminated bulb and a turned-off bulb.
- I am in the process of uploading my old small projects to GitHub, and this is one of them.
## Features

- Responsive design: The light bulb image adjusts its size to fit different screen sizes.
- Intuitive user interaction: Users can easily toggle the state of the light bulb by clicking on it.
- Minimalistic interface: The project is focused on the essential functionality, providing a clean and straightforward user experience.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git Bash:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bulb-toggle.git
   ```
   
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the bulb-toggle project.
3. Click on the light bulb image to toggle its state between on and off.
4. Feel free to customize the project by modifying the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files to suit your preferences or integrate it into other projects.
